The idea behind this app and how it works is to show the commonly eaten foods by

young irish adults day-to-day and how much calories are in each of them as not a 

lot of people are aware of how much they're actually eating. Then I have created 

a list of low calorie foods which can be substituted in with them. At the end of

each calorie page i have a calculator there in order for the user to calculate

their calory intake.


The main focus of this app is to make people aware of what they're eating.
